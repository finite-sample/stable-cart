### Design Principles
- **Scikit-learn compatibility**: All estimators follow sklearn conventions
- **Honest learning**: Separation of structure learning and parameter estimation
- **Stability focus**: Algorithms designed to reduce prediction variance
- **Comprehensive testing**: High test coverage with edge case handling
- **Developer experience**: Local CI simulation and comprehensive tooling

### Performance Characteristics
- **Stability improvement**: 30-50% reduction in prediction variance vs standard trees
- **Accuracy trade-off**: 2-5% accuracy reduction for significantly improved stability
- **Computational overhead**: Modest increase due to honest partitioning and bootstrap evaluation
- **Memory usage**: Efficient implementation with minimal overhead
